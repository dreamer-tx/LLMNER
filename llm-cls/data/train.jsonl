{"input": "Your task is to determine whether the marked part in the text is a medical entity of the given type. Pay attention to learning the entity boundaries. Please determine whether the entity marked with [] in the following text is of type:\nThere is a single [methionine codon-initiated open reading frame] of 1,458 nt in frame with a homeobox and a CAX repeat , and the open reading frame is predicted to encode a protein of 51,659 daltons.\nThe entity marked with [] to be judged:  methionine codon-initiated open reading frame, type: DNA.\nEntity types include: protein, RNA, DNA, cell_type, cell_line\nThe definitions of the entity types are as follows, Protein: In the GENIA dataset, a protein refers to entities that encompass genes and gene products, including proteins and RNA, as well as related entities such as domains, promoters, and complexes. RNA: In the GENIA dataset, RNA entities are annotated as gene products, which are part of a single class of entities that includes genes, proteins, and related entities. DNA: In the GENIA dataset, DNA entities are annotated as a distinct class of biological entities, separate from genes and gene products. Cell_type: In the GENIA dataset, cell types are annotated as distinct biological entities, recognized for their specific roles and characteristics within the biological context of the text. Cell_line: In the GENIA dataset, a cell line is defined as a genetically stable and homogeneous population of cultured cells, following the definition of Cell Line Ontology (CLO)", "drug_code": ["正确"]}
